To create a new thread in Java, you can either extend the Thread class or implement the Runnable interface. 
public class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        // Create a new thread by extending the Thread class
        Thread thread1 = new MyThread();
        thread1.start(); // Start the thread

        // Create a new thread by implementing the Runnable interface
        Runnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(runnable);
        thread2.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
